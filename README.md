# Proportional Election
A python script to give the list of elected politicians given a dataset.

## Dependencies
To run this script, you need to make sure that you have both `python3` and `pandas` lib installed into your computer.

## Execution
Just type inside this git-cloned folder `python3 eleicao.py` and check the output folder.

## Comments
This is a very little script made by me for the `LP II` test on my *computer science* course, that's why it doesn't have anything fancy at all, just the pure use of pandas lib to accomplish the job.
